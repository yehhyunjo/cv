Hi, I’m Yehhyun, a biomedical engineer and neuroscientist with a focus on low-intensity focused ultrasound (LIFU) stimulation for glioscience-driven therapeutics. I completed my Ph.D. at KAIST under the supervision of Professor Jenny Lee with a focus on developing novel ultrasound stimulation neurotools for integration with biological readout techniques such as MRI, EEG, and calcium imaging. I’m currently a postdoctoral researcher at the Center for Memory and Glioscience at IBS, where I’m conducting fundamental research on the mechanobiology of neuro-glio-vascular dynamics through the mechanism of ultrasound stimulation. 

My research explores how we can noninvasively stimulate specific neural circuits, and modulate mechanosensitivity in the CNS and PNS using low-intensity focused ultrasound. I design closed-loop systems that combine electrophysiology, calcium imaging, and genetic tools to precisely map and modulate brain activity in real time.

If you’re interested in neuromodulation, mechanobiology, mechanotransduction, or collaborative tool development for neuroscience, feel free to get in touch.
